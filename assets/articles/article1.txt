We're making a comic! You know, graphic novel, that sort of thing.
But why don't we just make a game? We are a game development team after all.
Well, how cheap do you think it is to make games? It isn't.
The least you could get away with, is about 50 dollars.
You have to pay for platform publishing licenses, computers, advertising, et cetera.
We aren't making triple a games, but we aren't skimping out.
We want to provide the best game experience for everyone playing.
And hey, a nice story to go along with it probably won't hurt. Probably. (Hopefully)
